[Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation)[API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

## Introduction

This API reference describes the RESTful, streaming, and realtime APIs you can use to interact with the OpenAI platform. REST APIs are usable via HTTP in any environment that supports HTTP requests. Language-specific SDKs are listed [on the libraries page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries).

## Authentication

The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Create, manage, and learn more about API keys in your [organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). API keys should be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service on the server.

API keys should be provided via [HTTP Bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/).

```bash
Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
```

If you belong to multiple organizations or access projects through a legacy user API key, pass a header to specify which organization and project to use for an API request:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: $ORGANIZATION_ID" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: $PROJECT_ID"
```

Usage from these API requests counts as usage for the specified organization and project.Organization IDs can be found on your [organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general) page. Project IDs can be found on your [general settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings) page by selecting the specific project.

## Debugging requests

In addition to [error codes](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes) returned from API responses, you can inspect HTTP response headers containing the unique ID of a particular API request or information about rate limiting applied to your requests. Below is an incomplete list of HTTP headers returned with API responses:

**API meta information**

- `openai-organization`: The [organization](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/production-best-practices#setting-up-your-organization) associated with the request
- `openai-processing-ms`: Time taken processing your API request
- `openai-version`: REST API version used for this request (currently `2020-10-01`)
- `x-request-id`: Unique identifier for this API request (used in troubleshooting)

**[Rate limiting information](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits)**

- `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`
- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens`
- `x-ratelimit-reset-requests`
- `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`

**OpenAI recommends logging request IDs in production deployments** for more efficient troubleshooting with our [support team](https://help.openai.com/en/), should the need arise. Our [official SDKs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries) provide a property on top-level response objects containing the value of the `x-request-id` header.

## Backward compatibility

OpenAI is committed to providing stability to API users by avoiding breaking changes in major API versions whenever reasonably possible. This includes:

- The REST API (currently `v1`)
- Our first-party [SDKs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries) (released SDKs adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/))
- [Model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) families (like `gpt-4o` or `o4-mini`)

**Model prompting behavior between snapshots is subject to change**. Model outputs are by their nature variable, so expect changes in prompting and model behavior between snapshots. For example, if you moved from `gpt-4o-2024-05-13` to `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, the same `system` or `user` messages could function differently between versions. The best way to ensure consistent prompting behavior and model output is to use pinned model versions, and to implement [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) for your applications.

**Backwards-compatible API changes**:

- Adding new resources (URLs) to the REST API and SDKs
- Adding new optional API parameters
- Adding new properties to JSON response objects or event data
- Changing the order of properties in a JSON response object
- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, like resource identifiers and UUIDs
- Adding new event types (in either streaming or the Realtime API)

See the [changelog](https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog) for a list of backwards-compatible changes and rare breaking changes.

## Responses

OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses. Supports text and image inputs, and text outputs. Create stateful interactions with the model, using the output of previous responses as input. Extend the model's capabilities with built-in tools for file search, web search, computer use, and more. Allow the model access to external systems and data using function calling.

## Create a model response

post https://api.openai.com/v1/responses

Creates a model response. Provide [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text) or [image](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images) inputs to generate [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text) or [JSON](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) outputs. Have the model call your own [custom code](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) or use built-in [tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools) like [web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search) or [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) to use your own data as input for the model's response.

#### Request body



background

boolean

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether to run the model response in the background. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background).



conversation

string or object

Optional

Defaults to null

The conversation that this response belongs to. Items from this conversation are prepended to `input_items` for this response request. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation after this response completes.

Show possible types



include

array

Optional

Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

- `web_search_call.action.sources`: Include the sources of the web search tool call.
- `code_interpreter_call.outputs`: Includes the outputs of python code execution in code interpreter tool call items.
- `computer_call_output.output.image_url`: Include image urls from the computer call output.
- `file_search_call.results`: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
- `message.input_image.image_url`: Include image urls from the input message.
- `message.output_text.logprobs`: Include logprobs with assistant messages.
- `reasoning.encrypted_content`: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning tokens in reasoning item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in multi-turn conversations when using the Responses API statelessly (like when the `store` parameter is set to `false`, or when an organization is enrolled in the zero data retention program).



input

string or array

Optional

Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

Learn more:

- [Text inputs and outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text)
- [Image inputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images)
- [File inputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files)
- [Conversation state](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state)
- [Function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)

Show possible types



instructions

string

Optional

A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with `previous_response_id`, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.



max_output_tokens

integer

Optional

An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).



max_tool_calls

integer

Optional

The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.



metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



model

string

Optional

Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the [model guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to browse and compare available models.



parallel_tool_calls

boolean

Optional

Defaults to true

Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.



previous_response_id

string

Optional

The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about [conversation state](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state). Cannot be used in conjunction with `conversation`.



prompt

object

Optional

Reference to a prompt template and its variables. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=responses#reusable-prompts).

Show properties



prompt_cache_key

string

Optional

Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the `user` field. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching).



reasoning

object

Optional

**gpt-5 and o-series models only**

Configuration options for [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

Show properties



safety_identifier

string

Optional

A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#safety-identifiers).



service_tier

string

Optional

Defaults to auto

Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

- If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
- If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
- If set to '[flex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing)' or '[priority](https://openai.com/api-priority-processing/)', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier.
- When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.



store

boolean

Optional

Defaults to true

Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.



stream

boolean

Optional

Defaults to false

If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format). See the [Streaming section below](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming) for more information.



stream_options

object

Optional

Defaults to null

Options for streaming responses. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

Show properties



temperature

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.



text

object

Optional

Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

- [Text inputs and outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text)
- [Structured Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)

Show properties



tool_choice

string or object

Optional

How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the `tools` parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.

Show possible types



tools

array

Optional

An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the `tool_choice` parameter.

We support the following categories of tools:

- **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like [web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search) or [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search). Learn more about [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools).
- **MCP Tools**: Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers or predefined connectors such as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about [MCP Tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
- **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments and outputs. Learn more about [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). You can also use custom tools to call your own code.

Show possible types



top_logprobs

integer

Optional

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.



top_p

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.



truncation

string

Optional

Defaults to disabled

The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

- `auto`: If the input to this Response exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping items from the beginning of the conversation.
- `disabled` (default): If the input size will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.



user

Deprecated

string

Optional

This field is being replaced by `safety_identifier` and `prompt_cache_key`. Use `prompt_cache_key` instead to maintain caching optimizations. A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#safety-identifiers).

## Get a model response

get https://api.openai.com/v1/responses/{response_id}

Retrieves a model response with the given ID.

#### Path parameters



response_id

string

Required

The ID of the response to retrieve.

#### Query parameters



include

array

Optional

Additional fields to include in the response. See the `include` parameter for Response creation above for more information.



include_obfuscation

boolean

Optional

When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds random characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming delta events to normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks. These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small amount of overhead to the data stream. You can set `include_obfuscation` to false to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between your application and the OpenAI API.



starting_after

integer

Optional

The sequence number of the event after which to start streaming.



stream

boolean

Optional

If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).

Show properties



instructions

string or array

A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with `previous_response_id`, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

Show possible types



max_output_tokens

integer

An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).



max_tool_calls

integer

The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.



metadata

map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



model

string

Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the [model guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to browse and compare available models.



object

string

The object type of this resource - always set to `response`.



output

array

An array of content items generated by the model.

- The length and order of items in the `output` array is dependent on the model's response.
- Rather than accessing the first item in the `output` array and assuming it's an `assistant` message with the content generated by the model, you might consider using the `output_text` property where supported in SDKs.

Show possible types



output_text

string

SDK Only

SDK-only convenience property that contains the aggregated text output from all `output_text` items in the `output` array, if any are present. Supported in the Python and JavaScript SDKs.



parallel_tool_calls

boolean

Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.



previous_response_id

string

Configuration options for [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

Show properties



safety_identifier

string

A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#safety-identifiers).



service_tier

string

Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

- If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
- If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
- If set to '[flex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing)' or '[priority](https://openai.com/api-priority-processing/)', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier.
- When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.



status

string

The status of the response generation. One of `completed`, `failed`, `in_progress`, `cancelled`, `queued`, or `incomplete`.



temperature

number

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

Show possible types



tools

array

An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the `tool_choice` parameter.

We support the following categories of tools:

- **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like [web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search) or [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search). Learn more about [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools).
- **MCP Tools**: Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers or predefined connectors such as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about [MCP Tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
- **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments and outputs. Learn more about [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). You can also use custom tools to call your own code.

Show possible types



top_logprobs

integer

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.



top_p

number

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.



truncation

string

The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

- `auto`: If the input to this Response exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping items from the beginning of the conversation.
- `disabled` (default): If the input size will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.



usage

object

Represents token usage details including input tokens, output tokens, a breakdown of output tokens, and the total tokens used.

Show properties



user

Deprecated

string

This field is being replaced by `safety_identifier` and `prompt_cache_key`. Use `prompt_cache_key` instead to maintain caching optimizations. A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse.

## Create speech

post https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech

Generates audio from the input text.

#### Request body



input

string

Required

The text to generate audio for. The maximum length is 4096 characters.



model

string

Required

One of the available [TTS models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#tts): `tts-1`, `tts-1-hd` or `gpt-4o-mini-tts`.



voice

string

Required

The voice to use when generating the audio. Supported voices are `alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `coral`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `sage`, `shimmer`, and `verse`. Previews of the voices are available in the [Text to speech guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech#voice-options).



instructions

string

Optional

Control the voice of your generated audio with additional instructions. Does not work with `tts-1` or `tts-1-hd`.



response_format

string

Optional

Defaults to mp3

The format to audio in. Supported formats are `mp3`, `opus`, `aac`, `flac`, `wav`, and `pcm`.



speed

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

The speed of the generated audio. Select a value from `0.25` to `4.0`. `1.0` is the default.



stream_format

string

Optional

Defaults to audio

The format to stream the audio in. Supported formats are `sse` and `audio`. `sse` is not supported for `tts-1` or `tts-1-hd`.

#### Returns

The audio file content or a [stream of audio events](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/speech-audio-delta-event).

DefaultSSE Stream Format

Example request

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini-tts",
    "input": "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.",
    "voice": "alloy"
  }' \
  --output speech.mp3
```

## Create transcription

post https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.

#### Request body



file

file

Required

The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.



model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. The options are `gpt-4o-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `whisper-1` (which is powered by our open source Whisper V2 model), and `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`.



chunking_strategy

"auto" or object

Optional

Controls how the audio is cut into chunks. When set to `"auto"`, the server first normalizes loudness and then uses voice activity detection (VAD) to choose boundaries. `server_vad` object can be provided to tweak VAD detection parameters manually. If unset, the audio is transcribed as a single block. Required when using `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` for inputs longer than 30 seconds.

Show possible types



include

array

Optional

Additional information to include in the transcription response. `logprobs` will return the log probabilities of the tokens in the response to understand the model's confidence in the transcription. `logprobs` only works with response_format set to `json` and only with the models `gpt-4o-transcribe` and `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`. This field is not supported when using `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`.



known_speaker_names

array

Optional

Optional list of speaker names that correspond to the audio samples provided in `known_speaker_references[]`. Each entry should be a short identifier (for example `customer` or `agent`). Up to 4 speakers are supported.



known_speaker_references

array

Optional

Optional list of audio samples (as [data URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs)) that contain known speaker references matching `known_speaker_names[]`. Each sample must be between 2 and 10 seconds, and can use any of the same input audio formats supported by `file`.



language

string

Optional

The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. `en`) format will improve accuracy and latency.



prompt

string

Optional

An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The [prompt](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text#prompting) should match the audio language. This field is not supported when using `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`.



response_format

string

Optional

Defaults to json

The format of the output, in one of these options: `json`, `text`, `srt`, `verbose_json`, `vtt`, or `diarized_json`. For `gpt-4o-transcribe` and `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, the only supported format is `json`. For `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`, the supported formats are `json`, `text`, and `diarized_json`, with `diarized_json` required to receive speaker annotations.



stream

boolean

Optional

Defaults to false

If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format). See the [Streaming section of the Speech-to-Text guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text?lang=curl#streaming-transcriptions) for more information.

Note: Streaming is not supported for the `whisper-1` model and will be ignored.



temperature

number

Optional

Defaults to 0

The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use [log probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability) to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.



timestamp_granularities

array

Optional

Defaults to segment

The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency. This option is not available for `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`.

#### Returns

The [transcription object](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/json-object), a [diarized transcription object](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/diarized-json-object), a [verbose transcription object](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/verbose-json-object), or a [stream of transcript events](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/transcript-text-delta-event).

Defaults to auto

Allows to set transparency for the background of the generated image(s). This parameter is only supported for `gpt-image-1`. Must be one of `transparent`, `opaque` or `auto` (default value). When `auto` is used, the model will automatically determine the best background for the image.

If `transparent`, the output format needs to support transparency, so it should be set to either `png` (default value) or `webp`.



model

string

Optional

Defaults to dall-e-2

The model to use for image generation. One of `dall-e-2`, `dall-e-3`, or `gpt-image-1`. Defaults to `dall-e-2` unless a parameter specific to `gpt-image-1` is used.



moderation

string or null

Optional

Defaults to auto

Control the content-moderation level for images generated by `gpt-image-1`. Must be either `low` for less restrictive filtering or `auto` (default value).

output_format

string or null

Optional

Defaults to png

The format in which the generated images are returned. This parameter is only supported for `gpt-image-1`. Must be one of `png`, `jpeg`, or `webp`.



partial_images

integer

Optional

Defaults to 0

The number of partial images to generate. This parameter is used for streaming responses that return partial images. Value must be between 0 and 3. When set to 0, the response will be a single image sent in one streaming event.

Note that the final image may be sent before the full number of partial images are generated if the full image is generated more quickly.



quality

string or null

Optional

Defaults to auto

The quality of the image that will be generated.

- `auto` (default value) will automatically select the best quality for the given model.
- `high`, `medium` and `low` are supported for `gpt-image-1`.

The format in which generated images with `dall-e-2` and `dall-e-3` are returned. Must be one of `url` or `b64_json`. URLs are only valid for 60 minutes after the image has been generated. This parameter isn't supported for `gpt-image-1` which will always return base64-encoded images.



size

string or null

Optional

Defaults to auto

The size of the generated images. Must be one of `1024x1024`, `1536x1024` (landscape), `1024x1536` (portrait), or `auto` (default value) for `gpt-image-1`, one of `256x256`, `512x512`, or `1024x1024` for `dall-e-2`, and one of `1024x1024`, `1792x1024`, or `1024x1792` for `dall-e-3`.



stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Generate the image in streaming mode. Defaults to `false`. See the [Image generation guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation) for more information. This parameter is only supported for `gpt-image-1`.



style

string or null

Optional

Defaults to vivid

The style of the generated images. This parameter is only supported for `dall-e-3`. Must be one of `vivid` or `natural`. Vivid causes the model to lean towards generating hyper-real and dramatic images. Natural causes the model to produce more natural, less hyper-real looking images.



user

string

Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

#### Returns

## Create image edit

post https://api.openai.com/v1/images/edits

Creates an edited or extended image given one or more source images and a prompt. This endpoint only supports `gpt-image-1` and `dall-e-2`.

#### Request body



image

string or array

Required

The image(s) to edit. Must be a supported image file or an array of images.

For `gpt-image-1`, each image should be a `png`, `webp`, or `jpg` file less than 50MB. You can provide up to 16 images.

For `dall-e-2`, you can only provide one image, and it should be a square `png` file less than 4MB.



prompt

string

Required

A text description of the desired image(s). The maximum length is 1000 characters for `dall-e-2`, and 32000 characters for `gpt-image-1`.



background

string or null

Optional

Defaults to auto

Allows to set transparency for the background of the generated image(s). This parameter is only supported for `gpt-image-1`. Must be one of `transparent`, `opaque` or `auto` (default value). When `auto` is used, the model will automatically determine the best background for the image.

If `transparent`, the output format needs to support transparency, so it should be set to either `png` (default value) or `webp`.



input_fidelity

string

Optional

Control how much effort the model will exert to match the style and features, especially facial features, of input images. This parameter is only supported for `gpt-image-1`. Unsupported for `gpt-image-1-mini`. Supports `high` and `low`. Defaults to `low`.



mask

file

Optional

An additional image whose fully transparent areas (e.g. where alpha is zero) indicate where `image` should be edited. If there are multiple images provided, the mask will be applied on the first image. Must be a valid PNG file, less than 4MB, and have the same dimensions as `image`.



model

string

Optional

Defaults to dall-e-2

The model to use for image generation. Only `dall-e-2` and `gpt-image-1` are supported. Defaults to `dall-e-2` unless a parameter specific to `gpt-image-1` is used.



n

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

The number of images to generate. Must be between 1 and 10.



output_compression

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 100

The compression level (0-100%) for the generated images. This parameter is only supported for `gpt-image-1` with the `webp` or `jpeg` output formats, and defaults to 100.



output_format

string or null

Optional

Defaults to png

The format in which the generated images are returned. This parameter is only supported for `gpt-image-1`. Must be one of `png`, `jpeg`, or `webp`. The default value is `png`.



partial_images

integer

Optional

Defaults to 0

The number of partial images to generate. This parameter is used for streaming responses that return partial images. Value must be between 0 and 3. When set to 0, the response will be a single image sent in one streaming event.

Note that the final image may be sent before the full number of partial images are generated if the full image is generated more quickly.



quality

string or null

Optional

Defaults to auto

The quality of the image that will be generated. `high`, `medium` and `low` are only supported for `gpt-image-1`. `dall-e-2` only supports `standard` quality. Defaults to `auto`.



response_format

string or null

Optional

Defaults to url

The format in which the generated images are returned. Must be one of `url` or `b64_json`. URLs are only valid for 60 minutes after the image has been generated. This parameter is only supported for `dall-e-2`, as `gpt-image-1` will always return base64-encoded images.



size

string or null

Optional

Defaults to 1024x1024

The size of the generated images. Must be one of `1024x1024`, `1536x1024` (landscape), `1024x1536` (portrait), or `auto` (default value) for `gpt-image-1`, and one of `256x256`, `512x512`, or `1024x1024` for `dall-e-2`.



stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Edit the image in streaming mode. Defaults to `false`. See the [Image generation guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation) for more information.



user

string

Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

#### Returns

## Create eval

post https://api.openai.com/v1/evals

Create the structure of an evaluation that can be used to test a model's performance. An evaluation is a set of testing criteria and the config for a data source, which dictates the schema of the data used in the evaluation. After creating an evaluation, you can run it on different models and model parameters. We support several types of graders and datasources. For more information, see the [Evals guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals).

#### Request body



data_source_config

object

Required

The configuration for the data source used for the evaluation runs. Dictates the schema of the data used in the evaluation.

Show possible types



testing_criteria

array

Required

A list of graders for all eval runs in this group. Graders can reference variables in the data source using double curly braces notation, like `{{item.variable_name}}`. To reference the model's output, use the `sample` namespace (ie, `{{sample.output_text}}`).

Show possible types



metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



name

string

Optional

The name of the evaluation.

#### Returns

The created [Eval](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/evals/object) object.

## Fine-tuning

Manage fine-tuning jobs to tailor a model to your specific training data. Related guide: [Fine-tune models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)

## Create fine-tuning job

post https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs

Creates a fine-tuning job which begins the process of creating a new model from a given dataset.

Response includes details of the enqueued job including job status and the name of the fine-tuned models once complete.

[Learn more about fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization)

#### Request body



model

string

Required

The name of the model to fine-tune. You can select one of the [supported models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning#which-models-can-be-fine-tuned).



training_file

string

Required

The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data.

See [upload file](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create) for how to upload a file.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.

The contents of the file should differ depending on if the model uses the [chat](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input), [completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) format, or if the fine-tuning method uses the [preference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/preference-input) format.

See the [fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization) for more details.



hyperparameters

Deprecated

object

Optional

The hyperparameters used for the fine-tuning job. This value is now deprecated in favor of `method`, and should be passed in under the `method` parameter.

Show properties



integrations

array or null

Optional

A list of integrations to enable for your fine-tuning job.

Show properties



metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



method

object

Optional

The method used for fine-tuning.

Show properties



seed

integer or null

Optional

The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results, but may differ in rare cases. If a seed is not specified, one will be generated for you.



suffix

string or null

Optional

Defaults to null

A string of up to 64 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.

For example, a `suffix` of "custom-model-name" would produce a model name like `ft:gpt-4o-mini:openai:custom-model-name:7p4lURel`.



validation_file

string or null

Optional

The ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data.

If you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation metrics periodically during fine-tuning. These metrics can be viewed in the fine-tuning results file. The same data should not be present in both train and validation files.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. You must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.

See the [fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization) for more details.

## Client secrets

REST API endpoint to generate ephemeral client secrets for use in client-side applications. Client secrets are short-lived tokens that can be passed to a client app, such as a web frontend or mobile client, which grants access to the Realtime API without leaking your main API key. You can configure a custom TTL for each client secret.

You can also attach session configuration options to the client secret, which will be applied to any sessions created using that client secret, but these can also be overridden by the client connection.

[Learn more about authentication with client secrets over WebRTC](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc).

## Create client secret

post https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets

Create a Realtime client secret with an associated session configuration.

#### Request body



expires_after

object

Optional

Configuration for the client secret expiration. Expiration refers to the time after which a client secret will no longer be valid for creating sessions. The session itself may continue after that time once started. A secret can be used to create multiple sessions until it expires.

Show properties



session

object

Optional

Session configuration to use for the client secret. Choose either a realtime session or a transcription session.

Show possible types

#### Returns

The created client secret and the effective session object. The client secret is a string that looks like `ek_1234`.

## Calls

REST endpoints for controlling WebRTC or SIP calls with the Realtime API. Accept or reject an incoming call, transfer it to another destination, or hang up the call once you are finished.

## Accept call

post https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls/{call_id}/accept

Accept an incoming SIP call and configure the realtime session that will handle it.

#### Path parameters



call_id

string

Required

The identifier for the call provided in the [`realtime.call.incoming`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/webhook-events/realtime/call/incoming) webhook.

#### Request body



type

string

Required

The type of session to create. Always `realtime` for the Realtime API.



audio

object

Optional

Configuration for input and output audio.

Show properties



include

array

Optional

Additional fields to include in server outputs.

`item.input_audio_transcription.logprobs`: Include logprobs for input audio transcription.



instructions

string

Optional

The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired behavior.

Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this field is not set and are visible in the `session.created` event at the start of the session.



max_output_tokens

integer or "inf"

Optional

Maximum number of output tokens for a single assistant response, inclusive of tool calls. Provide an integer between 1 and 4096 to limit output tokens, or `inf` for the maximum available tokens for a given model. Defaults to `inf`.



model

string

Optional

The Realtime model used for this session.



output_modalities

array

Optional

Defaults to audio

The set of modalities the model can respond with. It defaults to `["audio"]`, indicating that the model will respond with audio plus a transcript. `["text"]` can be used to make the model respond with text only. It is not possible to request both `text` and `audio` at the same time.



prompt

object

Optional

Reference to a prompt template and its variables. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=responses#reusable-prompts).

Show properties



tool_choice

string or object

Optional

Defaults to auto

How the model chooses tools. Provide one of the string modes or force a specific function/MCP tool.

Show possible types



tools

array

Optional

Tools available to the model.

Show possible types



tracing

"auto" or object

Optional

Defaults to null

Realtime API can write session traces to the [Traces Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/logs?api=traces). Set to null to disable tracing. Once tracing is enabled for a session, the configuration cannot be modified.

`auto` will create a trace for the session with default values for the workflow name, group id, and metadata.

Show possible types



truncation

string or object

Optional

When the number of tokens in a conversation exceeds the model's input token limit, the conversation be truncated, meaning messages (starting from the oldest) will not be included in the model's context. A 32k context model with 4,096 max output tokens can only include 28,224 tokens in the context before truncation occurs. Clients can configure truncation behavior to truncate with a lower max token limit, which is an effective way to control token usage and cost. Truncation will reduce the number of cached tokens on the next turn (busting the cache), since messages are dropped from the beginning of the context. However, clients can also configure truncation to retain messages up to a fraction of the maximum context size, which will reduce the need for future truncations and thus improve the cache rate. Truncation can be disabled entirely, which means the server will never truncate but would instead return an error if the conversation exceeds the model's input token limit.

Show possible types

#### Returns

Returns `200 OK` once OpenAI starts ringing the SIP leg with the supplied session configuration.

Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls/$CALL_ID/accept \

```

## Hang up call

post https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls/{call_id}/hangup

End an active Realtime API call, whether it was initiated over SIP or WebRTC.

#### Path parameters



call_id

string

Required

The identifier for the call. For SIP calls, use the value provided in the [`realtime.call.incoming`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/webhook-events/realtime/call/incoming) webhook. For WebRTC sessions, reuse the call ID returned in the `Location` header when creating the call with [`POST /v1/realtime/calls`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime/create-call).

#### Returns

Returns `200 OK` when OpenAI begins terminating the realtime call.

## Client events

These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

## 

## session.update

Send this event to update the session’s configuration. The client may send this event at any time to update any field except for `voice` and `model`. `voice` can be updated only if there have been no other audio outputs yet.

When the server receives a `session.update`, it will respond with a `session.updated` event showing the full, effective configuration. Only the fields that are present in the `session.update` are updated. To clear a field like `instructions`, pass an empty string. To clear a field like `tools`, pass an empty array. To clear a field like `turn_detection`, pass `null`.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event. This is an arbitrary string that a client may assign. It will be passed back if there is an error with the event, but the corresponding `session.updated` event will not include it.



session

object

Update the Realtime session. Choose either a realtime session or a transcription session.

Show possible types

## 

## input_audio_buffer.append

Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. A "commit" will create a new user message item in the conversation history from the buffer content and clear the buffer. Input audio transcription (if enabled) will be generated when the buffer is committed.

If VAD is enabled the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer manually. Input audio noise reduction operates on writes to the audio buffer.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike most other client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.



audio

string

Base64-encoded audio bytes. This must be in the format specified by the `input_audio_format` field in the session configuration.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.append`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.append

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_456",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
    "audio": "Base64EncodedAudioData"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.commit

Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription (if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response from the model. The server will respond with an `input_audio_buffer.committed` event.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.commit`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.commit

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_789",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.commit"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.clear

Send this event to clear the audio bytes in the buffer. The server will respond with an `input_audio_buffer.cleared` event.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.clear`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.clear

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_012",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.clear"
}
```

## 

## 

## conversation.item.create

Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a "history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.created` event, otherwise an `error` event will be sent.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



item

object

A single item within a Realtime conversation.

Show possible types



previous_item_id

string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation. If set to `root`, the new item will be added to the beginning of the conversation. If set to an existing ID, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.



type

string

The event type, must be `conversation.item.create`.

OBJECT conversation.item.create

```json

  "type": "conversation.item.create",
  "item": {

```

## conversation.item.retrieve

Send this event when you want to retrieve the server's representation of a specific item in the conversation history. This is useful, for example, to inspect user audio after noise cancellation and VAD. The server will respond with a `conversation.item.retrieved` event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



item_id

```

## conversation.item.truncate

Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.truncated` event.



audio_end_ms

integer

Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If the audio_end_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server will respond with an error.



content_index

integer

The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to `0`.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



item_id

string

The ID of the assistant message item to truncate. Only assistant message items can be truncated.

## conversation.item.delete

Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation history. The server will respond with a `conversation.item.deleted` event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

## 

## response.create

This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history by default.

The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the Response is complete.

The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like `instructions` and `tools`. If these are set, they will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

Responses can be created out-of-band of the default Conversation, meaning that they can have arbitrary input, and it's possible to disable writing the output to the Conversation. Only one Response can write to the default Conversation at a time, but otherwise multiple Responses can be created in parallel. The `metadata` field is a good way to disambiguate multiple simultaneous Responses.

Clients can set `conversation` to `none` to create a Response that does not write to the default Conversation. Arbitrary input can be provided with the `input` field, which is an array accepting raw Items and references to existing Items.

## response.cancel

Send this event to cancel an in-progress response. The server will respond with a `response.done` event with a status of `response.status=cancelled`. If there is no response to cancel, the server will respond with an error. It's safe to call `response.cancel` even if no response is in progress, an error will be returned the session will remain unaffected.

## conversation.item.added

Sent by the server when an Item is added to the default Conversation. This can happen in several cases:

- When the client sends a `conversation.item.create` event.
- When the input audio buffer is committed. In this case the item will be a user message containing the audio from the buffer.
- When the model is generating a Response. In this case the `conversation.item.added` event will be sent when the model starts generating a specific Item, and thus it will not yet have any content (and `status` will be `in_progress`).

The event will include the full content of the Item (except when model is generating a Response) except for audio data, which can be retrieved separately with a `conversation.item.retrieve` event if necessary.

## conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed

This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (when VAD is enabled). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. The transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

## 

## input_audio_buffer.committed

Returned when an input audio buffer is committed, either by the client or automatically in server VAD mode. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user message item that will be created, thus a `conversation.item.created` event will also be sent to the client.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created.



previous_item_id

string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. Can be `null` if the item has no predecessor.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.committed`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.committed

```

## input_audio_buffer.speech_started

Sent by the server when in `server_vad` mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event when speech stops. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).



audio_start_ms

integer

Milliseconds from the start of all audio written to the buffer during the session when speech was first detected. This will correspond to the beginning of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the `prefix_padding_ms` configured in the Session.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.speech_started

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_1516",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.speech_started",
    "audio_start_ms": 1000,
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped

Returned in `server_vad` mode when the server detects the end of speech in the audio buffer. The server will also send an `conversation.item.created` event with the user message item that is created from the audio buffer.



audio_end_ms

integer

Milliseconds since the session started when speech stopped. This will correspond to the end of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the `min_silence_duration_ms` configured in the Session.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_1718",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped",
    "audio_end_ms": 2000,
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.timeout_triggered

Returned when the Server VAD timeout is triggered for the input audio buffer. This is configured with `idle_timeout_ms` in the `turn_detection` settings of the session, and it indicates that there hasn't been any speech detected for the configured duration.

The `audio_start_ms` and `audio_end_ms` fields indicate the segment of audio after the last model response up to the triggering time, as an offset from the beginning of audio written to the input audio buffer. This means it demarcates the segment of audio that was silent and the difference between the start and end values will roughly match the configured timeout.

The empty audio will be committed to the conversation as an `input_audio` item (there will be a `input_audio_buffer.committed` event) and a model response will be generated. There may be speech that didn't trigger VAD but is still detected by the model, so the model may respond with something relevant to the conversation or a prompt to continue speaking.



audio_end_ms

integer

Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer at the time the timeout was triggered.



audio_start_ms

integer

Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer that was after the playback time of the last model response.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the item associated with this segment.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.timeout_triggered`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.timeout_triggered

Compare [Chat Completions with Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions?api-mode=responses).

------

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Learn more in the [text generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation), [vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) guides.

Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the response, particularly for newer reasoning models. Parameters that are only supported for reasoning models are noted below. For the current state of unsupported parameters in reasoning models, [refer to the reasoning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).

#### Request body



messages

array

Required

A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like [text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation), [images](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), and [audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

Show possible types



model

string

Required

Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the [model guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to browse and compare available models.



audio

object or null

Optional

Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with `modalities: ["audio"]`. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio).

Show properties



frequency_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.



function_call

Deprecated

string or object

Optional

Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.

`none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.

`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.

Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.

`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.

Show possible types



functions

Deprecated

array

Optional

Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

Show properties



logit_bias

map

Optional

Defaults to null

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.



logprobs

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.



max_completion_tokens

integer or null

Optional

An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).



max_tokens

Deprecated

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not compatible with [o-series models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).



metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



modalities

array

Optional

Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

```
["text"]
```

The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:

```
["text", "audio"]
```



n

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.



parallel_tool_calls

boolean

Optional

Defaults to true

Whether to enable [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use.



prediction

object

Optional

Configuration for a [Predicted Output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/predicted-outputs), which can greatly improve response times when large parts of the model response are known ahead of time. This is most common when you are regenerating a file with only minor changes to most of the content.

Show possible types



presence_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.



prompt_cache_key

string

Optional

Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the `user` field. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching).



reasoning_effort

string

Optional

Defaults to medium

Constrains effort on reasoning for [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently supported values are `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

Note: The `gpt-5-pro` model defaults to (and only supports) `high` reasoning effort.



response_format

object

Optional

An object specifying the format that the model must output.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is preferred for models that support it.

Show possible types



safety_identifier

string

Optional

A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#safety-identifiers).



seed

Deprecated

integer or null

Optional

This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.



service_tier

string

Optional

Defaults to auto

Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

- If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
- If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
- If set to '[flex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing)' or '[priority](https://openai.com/api-priority-processing/)', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier.
- When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.



stop

string / array / null

Optional

Defaults to null

Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.



store

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation) or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.

Supports text and image inputs. Note: image inputs over 8MB will be dropped.



stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format). See the [Streaming section below](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming) for more information, along with the [streaming responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses) guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.



stream_options

object

Optional

Defaults to null

Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

Show properties



temperature

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.



tool_choice

string or object

Optional

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.

Show possible types



tools

array

Optional

A list of tools the model may call. You can provide either [custom tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#custom-tools) or [function tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

Show possible types



top_logprobs

integer

Optional

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.



top_p

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.



user

Deprecated

string

Optional

This field is being replaced by `safety_identifier` and `prompt_cache_key`. Use `prompt_cache_key` instead to maintain caching optimizations. A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#safety-identifiers).



verbosity

string

Optional

Defaults to medium

Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Lower values will result in more concise responses, while higher values will result in more verbose responses. Currently supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`.



web_search_options

object

Optional

This tool searches the web for relevant results to use in a response. Learn more about the [web search tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=chat).

Show properties

#### Returns

Returns a [chat completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object) object, or a streamed sequence of [chat completion chunk](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming) objects if the request is streamed.

## AssistantsBeta

Build assistants that can call models and use tools to perform tasks.

[Get started with the Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants)

## Create assistantBeta

post https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants

Create an assistant with a model and instructions.

#### Request body



model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for descriptions of them.



description

string

Optional

The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.



instructions

string

Optional

The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.



metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



name

string

Optional

The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.



reasoning_effort

string

Optional

Defaults to medium

Constrains effort on reasoning for [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently supported values are `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

Note: The `gpt-5-pro` model defaults to (and only supports) `high` reasoning effort.



response_format

"auto" or object

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Show possible types



temperature

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.



tool_resources

object

Optional

A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the `code_interpreter` tool requires a list of file IDs, while the `file_search` tool requires a list of vector store IDs.

Show properties



tools

array

Optional

Defaults to []

A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `file_search`, or `function`.

Show possible types



top_p

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

#### Returns

An [assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/object) object.

before

string

Optional

A cursor for use in pagination. `before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include before=obj_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list.



limit

integer

Optional

Defaults to 20

A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.

## Delete assistantBeta

delete https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}

Delete an assistant.

#### Path parameters



assistant_id

string

Required

The ID of the assistant to delete.

#### Returns

Deletion status

Example request

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants/asst_abc123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2" \
  -X DELETE
```

Response

```json
{
  "id": "asst_abc123",
  "object": "assistant.deleted",
  "deleted": true
}
```

## The assistant objectBeta

Represents an `assistant` that can call the model and use tools.



created_at

integer

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the assistant was created.



description

string

The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.



id

string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.



instructions

string

The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.



metadata

map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



model

string

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for descriptions of them.



name

string

The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.



object

string

The object type, which is always `assistant`.



response_format

"auto" or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Show possible types



temperature

number

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.



tool_resources

object

A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the `code_interpreter` tool requires a list of file IDs, while the `file_search` tool requires a list of vector store IDs.

Show properties



tools

array

A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `file_search`, or `function`.

Show possible types



top_p

number

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Show possible types



stream

boolean or null

Optional

If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.



temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.



tool_choice

string or object

Optional

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

Show possible types



tools

array or null

Optional

Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

Show possible types



top_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.



truncation_strategy

object or null

Optional

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the initial context window of the run.

## Submit tool outputs to runBeta

post https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/submit_tool_outputs

When a run has the `status: "requires_action"` and `required_action.type` is `submit_tool_outputs`, this endpoint can be used to submit the outputs from the tool calls once they're all completed. All outputs must be submitted in a single request.

#### Path parameters



run_id

string

Required

The ID of the run that requires the tool output submission.



thread_id

string

Required

The ID of the [thread](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads) to which this run belongs.

#### Request body



tool_outputs

array

Required

A list of tools for which the outputs are being submitted.

Show properties



stream

boolean

Optional

If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.

#### Returns

The modified [run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/object) object matching the specified ID.

## The run objectBeta

Represents an execution run on a [thread](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads).



assistant_id

string

The ID of the [assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for execution of this run.



cancelled_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was cancelled.



completed_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was completed.



created_at

integer

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was created.



expires_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run will expire.



failed_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run failed.



id

string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.



incomplete_details

object or null

Details on why the run is incomplete. Will be `null` if the run is not incomplete.

Show properties



instructions

string

The instructions that the [assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for this run.



last_error

object or null

The last error associated with this run. Will be `null` if there are no errors.

Show properties



max_completion_tokens

integer or null

The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.



max_prompt_tokens

integer or null

The maximum number of prompt tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.



metadata

map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.



model

string

The model that the [assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for this run.



object

string

The object type, which is always `thread.run`.



parallel_tool_calls

boolean

Whether to enable [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use.



required_action

object or null

Details on the action required to continue the run. Will be `null` if no action is required.

Show properties



response_format

"auto" or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Show possible types



started_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was started.



status

string

The status of the run, which can be either `queued`, `in_progress`, `requires_action`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`, `failed`, `completed`, `incomplete`, or `expired`.



temperature

number or null

The sampling temperature used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.



thread_id

string

The ID of the [thread](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads) that was executed on as a part of this run.



tool_choice

string or object

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

Show possible types



tools

array

The list of tools that the [assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for this run.

Show possible types



top_p

number or null

## StreamingBeta

Stream the result of executing a Run or resuming a Run after submitting tool outputs. You can stream events from the [Create Thread and Run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createThreadAndRun), [Create Run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun), and [Submit Tool Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/submitToolOutputs) endpoints by passing `"stream": true`. The response will be a [Server-Sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) stream. Our Node and Python SDKs provide helpful utilities to make streaming easy. Reference the [Assistants API quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) to learn more.

## The message delta objectBeta

Represents a message delta i.e. any changed fields on a message during streaming.



delta

object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the Message.

Show properties



id

string

The identifier of the message, which can be referenced in API endpoints.



object

string

{
  "id": "msg_123",
  "object": "thread.message.delta",
  "delta": {
    "content": [
      {
        "index": 0,
        "type": "text",
        "text": { "value": "Hello", "annotations": [] }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## The run step delta objectBeta

Represents a run step delta i.e. any changed fields on a run step during streaming.



delta

object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the run step.

Show properties



id

string

The identifier of the run step, which can be referenced in API endpoints.



object

string

The object type, which is always `thread.run.step.delta`.

OBJECT The run step delta object

```json
{
  "id": "step_123",
  "object": "thread.run.step.delta",
  "delta": {
    "step_details": {
      "type": "tool_calls",
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "index": 0,
          "id": "call_123",
          "type": "code_interpreter",
          "code_interpreter": { "input": "", "outputs": [] }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Assistant stream eventsBeta

Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

```text
event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
```

We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a `thread.message.completed` event.

We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to integrate the Assistants API with streaming.

## Administration

Programmatically manage your organization. The Audit Logs endpoint provides a log of all actions taken in the organization for security and monitoring purposes. To access these endpoints please generate an Admin API Key through the [API Platform Organization overview](https://platform.openai.com/organization/admin-keys). Admin API keys cannot be used for non-administration endpoints. For best practices on setting up your organization, please refer to this [guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/production-best-practices#setting-up-your-organization)

## Admin API Keys

Admin API keys enable Organization Owners to programmatically manage various aspects of their organization, including users, projects, and API keys. These keys provide administrative capabilities, such as creating, updating, and deleting users; managing projects; and overseeing API key lifecycles.

Key Features of Admin API Keys:

- User Management: Invite new users, update roles, and remove users from the organization.
- Project Management: Create, update, archive projects, and manage user assignments within projects.
- API Key Oversight: List, retrieve, and delete API keys associated with projects.

Only Organization Owners have the authority to create and utilize Admin API keys. To manage these keys, Organization Owners can navigate to the Admin Keys section of their API Platform dashboard.

For direct access to the Admin Keys management page, Organization Owners can use the following link:

https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys

It's crucial to handle Admin API keys with care due to their elevated permissions. Adhering to best practices, such as regular key rotation and assigning appropriate permissions, enhances security and ensures proper governance within the organization.

## Usage

The **Usage API** provides detailed insights into your activity across the OpenAI API. It also includes a separate [Costs endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/usage/costs), which offers visibility into your spend, breaking down consumption by invoice line items and project IDs.

While the Usage API delivers granular usage data, it may not always reconcile perfectly with the Costs due to minor differences in how usage and spend are recorded. For financial purposes, we recommend using the [Costs endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/usage/costs) or the [Costs tab](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage) in the Usage Dashboard, which will reconcile back to your billing invoice.

## CompletionsLegacy

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions along with the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position. Most developer should use our [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation#text-generation-models) to leverage our best and newest models.

## Create completionLegacy

post https://api.openai.com/v1/completions

Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters.

#### Request body



model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for descriptions of them.



prompt

string or array

Required

The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.



best_of

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return – `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.



echo

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion



frequency_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation)



logit_bias

map

Optional

Defaults to null

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.



logprobs

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to null

Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.



max_tokens

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 16

The maximum number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) that can be generated in the completion.

The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.



n

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

How many completions to generate for each prompt.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.



presence_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation)



seed

integer or null

Optional

If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.

Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.



stop

string / array / null

Optional

Defaults to null

Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.



stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).



stream_options

object

Optional

Defaults to null

Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

Show properties



suffix

string or null

Optional

Defaults to null

The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

This parameter is only supported for `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`.



temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.



top_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.



user

string

Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

#### Returns

Returns a [completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/object) object, or a sequence of completion objects if the request is streamed.

## Realtime BetaLegacy

Communicate with a multimodal model in real time over low latency interfaces like WebRTC, WebSocket, and SIP. Natively supports speech-to-speech as well as text, image, and audio inputs and outputs. [Learn more about the Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime).

## Realtime Beta session tokens

REST API endpoint to generate ephemeral session tokens for use in client-side applications.

## Create session

post https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions

Create an ephemeral API token for use in client-side applications with the Realtime API. Can be configured with the same session parameters as the `session.update` client event.

It responds with a session object, plus a `client_secret` key which contains a usable ephemeral API token that can be used to authenticate browser clients for the Realtime API.

#### Request body



client_secret

object

Required

Ephemeral key returned by the API.

Show properties



input_audio_format

string

Optional

The format of input audio. Options are `pcm16`, `g711_ulaw`, or `g711_alaw`.



input_audio_transcription

object

Optional

Configuration for input audio transcription, defaults to off and can be set to `null` to turn off once on. Input audio transcription is not native to the model, since the model consumes audio directly. Transcription runs asynchronously and should be treated as rough guidance rather than the representation understood by the model.

Show properties



instructions

string

Optional

The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired behavior. Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this field is not set and are visible in the `session.created` event at the start of the session.



max_response_output_tokens

integer or "inf"

Optional

Maximum number of output tokens for a single assistant response, inclusive of tool calls. Provide an integer between 1 and 4096 to limit output tokens, or `inf` for the maximum available tokens for a given model. Defaults to `inf`.



modalities

Optional

The set of modalities the model can respond with. To disable audio, set this to ["text"].



output_audio_format

string

Optional

The format of output audio. Options are `pcm16`, `g711_ulaw`, or `g711_alaw`.



prompt

object

Optional

Reference to a prompt template and its variables. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=responses#reusable-prompts).

Show properties



speed

number

Optional

Defaults to 1

The speed of the model's spoken response. 1.0 is the default speed. 0.25 is the minimum speed. 1.5 is the maximum speed. This value can only be changed in between model turns, not while a response is in progress.



temperature

number

Optional

Sampling temperature for the model, limited to [0.6, 1.2]. Defaults to 0.8.



tool_choice

string

Optional

How the model chooses tools. Options are `auto`, `none`, `required`, or specify a function.



tools

array

Optional

Tools (functions) available to the model.

Show properties



tracing

"auto" or object

Optional

Configuration options for tracing. Set to null to disable tracing. Once tracing is enabled for a session, the configuration cannot be modified.

`auto` will create a trace for the session with default values for the workflow name, group id, and metadata.

Show possible types



truncation

string or object

Optional

When the number of tokens in a conversation exceeds the model's input token limit, the conversation be truncated, meaning messages (starting from the oldest) will not be included in the model's context. A 32k context model with 4,096 max output tokens can only include 28,224 tokens in the context before truncation occurs. Clients can configure truncation behavior to truncate with a lower max token limit, which is an effective way to control token usage and cost. Truncation will reduce the number of cached tokens on the next turn (busting the cache), since messages are dropped from the beginning of the context. However, clients can also configure truncation to retain messages up to a fraction of the maximum context size, which will reduce the need for future truncations and thus improve the cache rate. Truncation can be disabled entirely, which means the server will never truncate but would instead return an error if the conversation exceeds the model's input token limit.

Show possible types



turn_detection

object

Optional

Configuration for turn detection. Can be set to `null` to turn off. Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.

Show properties



voice

string

Optional

The voice the model uses to respond. Voice cannot be changed during the session once the model has responded with audio at least once. Current voice options are `alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `coral`, `echo`, `sage`, `shimmer`, and `verse`.

#### Returns

The created Realtime session object, plus an ephemeral key

## Create transcription session

post https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/transcription_sessions

Create an ephemeral API token for use in client-side applications with the Realtime API specifically for realtime transcriptions. Can be configured with the same session parameters as the `transcription_session.update` client event.

It responds with a session object, plus a `client_secret` key which contains a usable ephemeral API token that can be used to authenticate browser clients for the Realtime API.

#### Request body



include

array

Optional

The set of items to include in the transcription. Current available items are: `item.input_audio_transcription.logprobs`



input_audio_format

string

Optional

Defaults to pcm16

The format of input audio. Options are `pcm16`, `g711_ulaw`, or `g711_alaw`. For `pcm16`, input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 24kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order.



input_audio_noise_reduction

object

Optional

Defaults to null

Configuration for input audio noise reduction. This can be set to `null` to turn off. Noise reduction filters audio added to the input audio buffer before it is sent to VAD and the model. Filtering the audio can improve VAD and turn detection accuracy (reducing false positives) and model performance by improving perception of the input audio.

## Realtime Beta client events

These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

## 

## session.update

Send this event to update the session’s default configuration. The client may send this event at any time to update any field, except for `voice`. However, note that once a session has been initialized with a particular `model`, it can’t be changed to another model using `session.update`.

When the server receives a `session.update`, it will respond with a `session.updated` event showing the full, effective configuration. Only the fields that are present are updated. To clear a field like `instructions`, pass an empty string.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



session

## 

## input_audio_buffer.append

Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. In Server VAD mode, the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer manually.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike made other client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.



audio

string

Base64-encoded audio bytes. This must be in the format specified by the `input_audio_format` field in the session configuration.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.append`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.append

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_456",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
    "audio": "Base64EncodedAudioData"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.commit

Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription (if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response from the model. The server will respond with an `input_audio_buffer.committed` event.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.commit`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.commit

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_789",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.commit"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.clear

Send this event to clear the audio bytes in the buffer. The server will respond with an `input_audio_buffer.cleared` event.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.clear`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.clear

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_012",

## 

## 

## conversation.item.create

Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a "history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.created` event, otherwise an `error` event will be sent.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



item

object

A single item within a Realtime conversation.

Show possible types



previous_item_id

string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation. If set to `root`, the new item will be added to the beginning of the conversation. If set to an existing ID, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.



type

string

The event type, must be `conversation.item.create`.

OBJECT conversation.item.create

```json
{
  "type": "conversation.item.create",
  "item": {
    "type": "message",

    ]
  },
  "event_id": "b904fba0-0ec4-40af-8bbb-f908a9b26793",
}
```

## conversation.item.retrieve

Send this event when you want to retrieve the server's representation of a specific item in the conversation history. This is useful, for example, to inspect user audio after noise cancellation and VAD. The server will respond with a `conversation.item.retrieved` event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



item_id

string

The ID of the item to retrieve.



type

string

The event type, must be `conversation.item.retrieve`.

    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.retrieve",
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
```

## conversation.item.truncate

Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.truncated` event.



audio_end_ms

integer

Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If the audio_end_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server will respond with an error.



content_index

integer

The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to 0.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



item_id

string

The ID of the assistant message item to truncate. Only assistant message items can be truncated.

    "content_index": 0,
    "audio_end_ms": 1500
}
```

## conversation.item.delete

Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation history. The server will respond with a `conversation.item.deleted` event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.



item_id

string

The ID of the item to delete.

    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.delete",
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
```

## 

## response.create

This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history.

The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the Response is complete.

The `response.create` event can optionally include inference configuration like `instructions`, and `temperature`. These fields will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

Responses can be created out-of-band of the default Conversation, meaning that they can have arbitrary input, and it's possible to disable writing the output to the Conversation. Only one Response can write to the default Conversation at a time, but otherwise multiple Responses can be created in parallel.

Clients can set `conversation` to `none` to create a Response that does not write to the default Conversation. Arbitrary input can be provided with the `input` field, which is an array accepting raw Items and references to existing Items.



event_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

## conversation.item.created

Returned when a conversation item is created. There are several scenarios that produce this event:

- The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce either one or two Items, which will be of type `message` (role `assistant`) or type `function_call`.
- The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the server (in `server_vad` mode). The server will take the content of the input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.
- The client has sent a `conversation.item.create` event to add a new Item to the Conversation.

## 

## conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed

This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (in `server_vad` mode). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. The transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

## 

## input_audio_buffer.committed

Returned when an input audio buffer is committed, either by the client or automatically in server VAD mode. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user message item that will be created, thus a `conversation.item.created` event will also be sent to the client.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created.



previous_item_id

    "type": "input_audio_buffer.cleared"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.speech_started

Sent by the server when in `server_vad` mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event when speech stops. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).



audio_start_ms

integer

Milliseconds from the start of all audio written to the buffer during the session when speech was first detected. This will correspond to the beginning of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the `prefix_padding_ms` configured in the Session.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.speech_started

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_1516",

    "audio_start_ms": 1000,
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped

Returned in `server_vad` mode when the server detects the end of speech in the audio buffer. The server will also send an `conversation.item.created` event with the user message item that is created from the audio buffer.



audio_end_ms

integer

Milliseconds since the session started when speech stopped. This will correspond to the end of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the `min_silence_duration_ms` configured in the Session.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped

```json
{
    "event_id": "event_1718",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped",
    "audio_end_ms": 2000,
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
```

## input_audio_buffer.timeout_triggered

Returned when the Server VAD timeout is triggered for the input audio buffer. This is configured with `idle_timeout_ms` in the `turn_detection` settings of the session, and it indicates that there hasn't been any speech detected for the configured duration.

The `audio_start_ms` and `audio_end_ms` fields indicate the segment of audio after the last model response up to the triggering time, as an offset from the beginning of audio written to the input audio buffer. This means it demarcates the segment of audio that was silent and the difference between the start and end values will roughly match the configured timeout.

The empty audio will be committed to the conversation as an `input_audio` item (there will be a `input_audio_buffer.committed` event) and a model response will be generated. There may be speech that didn't trigger VAD but is still detected by the model, so the model may respond with something relevant to the conversation or a prompt to continue speaking.



audio_end_ms

integer

Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer at the time the timeout was triggered.



audio_start_ms

integer

Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer that was after the playback time of the last model response.



event_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.



item_id

string

The ID of the item associated with this segment.



type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.timeout_triggered`.
